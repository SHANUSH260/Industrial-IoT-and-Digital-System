Smart Machine Monitor
**The Idea:**
I wanted to build a system that could "watch" an industrial motor and automatically spot when something goes wrong. 

**What it does:**
- It creates a digital pulse of a machine.
- I used an AI model  to act as a 24/7 security guard. 
- It ignores normal operational noise but flags sudden faults or spikes in red.

**What I learned:**
The biggest challenge was making sure the AI could tell the difference between normal noise and an actual failure. It taught me a lot about signal processing and how much data matters in industrial automation.
